\begin{frame}{Recap}
  The \textbg{robotics industry} is evolving rapidly towards the best practices adopted in the \textbg{software industry} in the last 30 years.\\
  \bigskip
  \textbg{ROS 2} is an open-source \textbg{middleware} for the development of robotics software and \textbg{distributed} control architectures.\\
  \bigskip
  ROS 2 is currently based on the \textbg{DDS} middleware to implement the communication layer, but this may change in the near future because of \textbg{scalability issues} and \textbg{lossy networks}.\\
  \bigskip
  Today, it is the \textbg{de facto} standard for the development of robotic applications, and it is supported by a \textbg{vast community} of developers and researchers.\\
