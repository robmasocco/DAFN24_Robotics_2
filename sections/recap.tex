  \textbg{ROS 2} is a \textbg{DDS}-based, open-source \textbg{middleware} for the development of robotics software and \textbg{distributed} control architectures.
  \newline\newline
  Today, it is the \textbg{de facto} standard for the development of robotic applications, and it is supported by a \textbg{vast community} of developers and researchers.
  \newline\newline
  The robotics industry is also exploring the adoption of \textbg{Docker containers} into the development workflow, benefitting from some of their main features.
